    <h1>Play Framework</h1>
    <h2>Short description</h2>
    <p></p>
    
    <h2>Technical features</h2>
    <h3>MVC solution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        The model layer is not strictly defined by Play. It can be an ordinary Java class, a JPA entity...
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For the controller layer Play provides a Controller superclass which much be inherited.
        A controller consists of different Actions ()
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
    </p>
    
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>...</p>
    
    <h3>Form handling</h3>
    <p>
        A FormFactory creates a Form object with a binding to a model class.
        
        Html form parameters are automatically set 
        
                
    [Annotation tags.]
    
    
    </p>
    <h3>Validation</h3>
    <p>
        Entity classes can be annotated with JSR-303 (Bean Validation) annotation or Play's own Constraints annotations.
        These are automatically used for validating and rendering Forms.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Type conversion</h3>
    <p>...</p>
    
    <h3>Server-side handling of user interface events</h3>
    <p>...</p>
    
    <h3>Rendering</h3>
    <p>
        Play uses the Twirl template engine. It uses Scala as expression language.
        
        Usage is similar to JSTL. For simple templates you can convert from one to the other by replacing the '$'-signs with an '@' sign.
    </p>
        
    <pre>
    <code>
        JSTL: ${item.id}
        TWIRL: @item.getId()
    </code>
    </pre> 
    
    <p>    
        Other constructs like for loops are slightly different since they use the Scala syntax.
    </p>
    
        <pre>
        <code>
        @for(item <- list){
            &lt;li&gt;@item.getName()&lt;/li&gt;
        }
        </code>
        </pre>
    
    <p>    
        Twirl is not so strict with delimiters. The @ sign indicates the start of an expression but there is no need to specify an end delimiter.
        The engine can determine this automagicaly.
        
    <!--This results in less overhead in delimiter tags, but may harm readability since.-->
    </p>
    
    <h3>I18N and L10N</h3>
    <p>Each language is defined in a seperate text file containing key value pairs. (Same format as ResourceBundles in JSP).</p>
    <p>Using it in the templates is really simple:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;span&gt;@Messages("viewall")&lt;/span&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This is much shorter and clearer than the JSTL equivalent.</p>    
    
    <h3>JavaScript integration</h3>
    <p>
        A JavaScript router can be generated. This is used to generate URLs in JavaScript code (for instance: A JQuery Ajax Request).
        
    </p>
    
    <h3> ...</h3>
    
    
    
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <h3>Kind of documentation, quality, up-todate</h3>
    <p>
        Official documentation consists of a series of written pages explaining each concept of the framework.
        The documentation is split into a part for Java developers and Scala developers.
        They both deal with the same subjects but differ in the language (Java or Scala) of the examples.
        
        The documentation and API are sometimes lacking in verbosity leaving the developer to find out certain details. (For instance: a )
        
        Some features (certain form related template tags) are only mentioned in the API and not in the documentation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        While the written documentation is up to date, some other parts are not. 
        Most notably: the introduction video on the main site uses an outdated version of the framework.
        Many other examples from other sources also use older versions.

        <h3>Ease of use</h3>
        <p>...</p>
        <h3>Ease of installation</h3>
        <p>
            Play uses a custom IDE and server running in a web browser. Installation exists of downloading a zip file and running a bash script to run this service.
            
            The setup does however take some time (apparently due to many dependencies being downloaded) but requires very little input from the user.
            Since a server is included the installation is painless.
            
            Using your own editor like Netbeans requires some additional configuration steps.
            
            Deploying the final application on a production server may be somewhat difficult since no war files can be generated.
            (Play uses its own format)
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Learning curve</h3>
        <p>
            The initial learning curve is gently. With the help of the many quick start projects available from the editor you can get fast results.
        </p>

            The provided editor lists many quick start projects to start from.
